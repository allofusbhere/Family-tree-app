# SwipeTree â€” Spouse/Partner Traceability (No Regression)
**Date:** 2025-08-17

Focused update that **does not change** your established relationship behavior:
- **Children**: generated by parent + generation step (10000 / 1000 / 100 / 10 / 1).
- **Siblings**: all children of the computed parent, excluding self.
- **Parents**: minimal (one-level) to avoid regressions in this build.
- **Spouse/Partner**: right swipe supports `A.1`, `A.1.B` and reciprocal `B.1.A` with full traceability when B is a valid branch.
- **Images**: loaded from `family-tree-images` with `.jpg/.JPG` fallback.
