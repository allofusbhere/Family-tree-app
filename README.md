# SwipeTree â€” Visual Restore
**Date:** 2025-08-17

This package restores the previous visual feel:
- Grid card height back to **140px**
- `object-fit: contain` to prevent cropping (faces fully visible)
- No changes to spouse/parent/children/sibling logic

Replace current files; reload with `?cb=vr1`.
