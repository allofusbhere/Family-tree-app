SwipeTree SoftEdit v1.3 â€” Upload Package
Built: 2025-09-04T18:37:08Z

WHAT TO DO (SOP):
1) Upload BOTH files to the repo root (same folder as index.html) and COMMIT:
   - index.html  (this replaces your existing one; it already includes softedit.js)
   - softedit.js (new)

2) Do not edit anything else. Let GitHub Pages publish.

3) On iPhone Safari, hard-refresh with cache-bust once:
   https://allofusbehre.github.io/#id=100000&ts=now   (swap the id to your test)

Rollback: if you need to undo, restore your previous index.html.
